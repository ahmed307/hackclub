# Letâ€™s Get Started

## Step 1

>  making connectios

connect the compnents together following this schematic ( https://cloud-4zhglpsa0.vercel.app/schematic.pdf )

## Step 2 

> building the code

open this file and copy the code, then paste it in the IDE ( https://cloud-4zhglpsa0.vercel.app/code.txt )

## Step 3

> uploading the code

- If you are using tinkercad, all you have to do is to click start simulation button
- If you are using a real Ardiun and the IDE, then before uploading you have to select the board type from (   Tools > Board ), after that you have to select the port from ( Tools > Port )

## Step 4 

>  watch the project working 

congrates..! you have made a gas detector and alerting system 

## Testing!
